# The Guide

[*The Guide*](http://writingguide.geneseo.edu) is a writing guide for students at SUNY Geneseo that my colleague Celia Easton and I first wrote for the web in the late 1990's. We've revised it a few times since then.

*The Guide* is currently published from [milnegeneseo](https://github.com/milnegeneseo/suny-geneseo-writing-guide), where all further development will take place.
