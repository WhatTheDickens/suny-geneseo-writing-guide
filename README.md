# The Guide

[*The Guide*](http://writingguide.geneseo.edu) is a writing guide for students at SUNY Geneseo that my colleague Celia Easton and I first wrote for the web in the late 1990's. We've revised it a few times since then.

Future revisions to *The Guide* will take place here and tested on *The Guide*'s [GitHub pages site](https://whatthedickens.github.io/suny-geneseo-writing-guide).
