Organization
------------

A persuasive essay contains

-   an [introduction](#introduction), which includes a
    [thesis](#thesis);
-   a [body](#body);
-   a [conclusion](#conclusion).

Unless the conventions of your discipline or the instructions of your
professor require it, you should not label these parts, particularly in
short papers. (In some disciplines, convention demands an **abstract**
at the head of the paper; if you're unsure whether to include one, check
with your professor.)

### Organization: Introduction

To paraphrase the literary scholar Ian Watt, introductions are
infinitely expandable and largely expendable. While you certainly should
avoid an abrupt beginning, most student writers err in the opposite
direction, providing too much material - often irrelevant material - in
an effort to ease into the topic. The standard introduction is shaped
like an inverted pyramid, beginning with fairly broad information or
assertions and narrowing down toward the thesis. This strategy works
well as long as you maintain a reasonable proportion between the base
and the tip of the pyramid. An essay on a nineteenth-century novel might
begin with a few relevant facts about Victorian Britain or the novel's
author; it shouldn't begin with the hackneyed phrase that opens far too
many student essays: "Throughout history . . . " In general:

-   Avoid beginning with Great Truths about the Human Condition.
    (*Example:* "Throughout history writers have concerned themselves
    with the effect of modern science on Western Civilization.") At best
    you'll sound pompous, at worst foolish. (The example just quoted
    makes no sense: writers *throughout* history worried about the
    effect of *modern* science?)
-   Don't waste time "praising the bard." Your English professor doesn't
    need to be told that Shakespeare was a great writer. Your Sociology
    professor already knows that Weber was a seminal figure in
    the field.
-   Don't include irrelevant or extraneous facts or ideas. Historical,
    biographical, or other facts that have no immediate bearing on your
    thesis make tedious reading.
-   Use quotations judiciously. The words of another writer, such as a
    recognized expert in the field under discussion, should be a
    complement to - never a substitute for - your own thinking. You may
    be less tempted to rely on someone else's eloquence if you put a
    relevant quotation in an epigraph. (See the head of this document.)
    Don't use quotations that you've seen used frequently by other
    writers; what isn't news to you is unlikely to hold novelty for
    your reader. "Someone once said" is an acceptable attribution only
    when the source of the quotation is truly anonymous; don't use it in
    place of finding out who actually said the words in question.
-   Don't try to manufacture an introduction by restating or
    paraphrasing your professor's assignment.

Your mother was right: if you don't have anything good to say, don't say
anything at all. It's better just to start with the thesis than to
include material that's trite, too broad, or of dubious relevance to the
topic. A well-phrased thesis shouldn't sound abrupt anyway, and
springing it at the very beginning may actually be a good way to catch
your reader's attention.

### Organization: Thesis

The heart of your introduction, the **thesis** is the argument for which
your essay will provide support. The first requirement for a thesis,
then, is that it be a claim in *need* of support. If you find it hard to
imagine a reader who would disagree with your claim, the claim is
probably not a thesis but a truism. At the very least, you should be
able to picture your reader thinking, "I'd probably agree with that, but
I'd like to see some evidence before signing on." Keep the following in
mind:

-   Make your thesis prominent. The most common location is the end of
    the first paragraph. A long build-up might warrant a delay to the
    second paragraph, but consider whether the build-up is
    really necessary. (See [Introduction](#introduction).) Wait until
    the third paragraph or later and you'll risk boring or frustrating
    your reader, who is eager to know where your paper's going.
-   A deliberately controversial thesis - one that's almost certain to
    meet with disagreement - can make for a powerful and impressive
    piece of writing. But to pull it off you'll have to be especially
    thorough in supplying evidence and anticipating objections.
-   A question is not a thesis. If you end your first paragraph by
    asking "Does nature or nurture play the greater role in shaping
    human character?" you haven't made a claim. It's great to pose
    questions like this to yourself as you think through the topic, but
    you don't have a thesis until you're prepared to defend a particular
    *answer* to such a question.
-   Your professor's topic is not a thesis (not usually, at least).
    Unless your professor has deliberately handed you an argument to
    support or refute, his or her assigned topic simply defines a
    general subject area within which you are to develop your
    own thesis.
-   It's particularly easy to confuse topic and thesis in
    compare/contrast assignments. If your assignment is to compare
    Jonathan Swift's and John Locke's views of law, you may think you
    have a thesis when you write, "Swift's and Locke's views of law have
    many similarities, but also some important differences." However,
    this "claim" merely restates the original topic, which assumed that
    you'd find both similarities and differences between the authors. A
    compare/contrast thesis should detail, in brief, the major
    similarities and differences that the paper will explore.
-   Write about the topic, not about your writing. Unless specifically
    instructed otherwise, avoid formulas such as "The purpose of this
    paper is . . . " and "In this paper I will show . . ." They're
    tedious and cumbersome. Say what you have to say without announcing
    that you're going to say it. And unless it's part of the assignment,
    don't give an autobiographical account of how you got interested in
    the topic or arrived at your thesis.

### Organization: Body

The body of your essay presents the **evidence** in support of your
thesis. There are several things you should keep in mind as you compose
this part of your essay:

-   Effective persuasion generally involves *analyzing* the objects,
    events, situations, or issues under discussion. Remember that the
    word "analyze" means, literally, to "break down" into parts. Ask
    yourself how you might break your subject into parts and examine how
    the parts relate to one another. Note that the noun form of
    *analyze* is *analysis*, not *analyzation*.
-   Your organization can tell you whether or not you're analyzing. If
    you've organized a literary essay around the plot of a story or the
    sequence of lines in a poem, or if you've organized a history essay
    around a simple chronology of events, chances are you're *not*
    analyzing your subject. Remember that you break a subject into parts
    in order to examine relationships, such as cause and effect, or to
    isolate a single part (such as character or theme in literature) for
    intensive study. To do this well almost invariably requires that you
    consider the parts out of their temporal sequence.
-   Each paragraph in the body of your essay should express one
    main idea. You should generally be able to point to one sentence in
    the paragraph as the "topic sentence," the one with the main idea.
    Other sentences in the paragraph should provide evidentiary and
    logical support for this idea.
-   Make sure to provide clear **transitions** between paragraphs
    and between sentences within a paragraph. The strongest transitions
    are those that indicate logical relationships and employ words such
    as *therefore, however, because, although.* While transitions such
    as *and, in addition, also,* and *next* certainly have their place,
    they are weaker because they don't reveal logical relationships.
-   Provide detailed, specific, and appropriate **evidence** for
    your ideas. The form for proper documentation of this evidence will
    vary from discipline to discipline (and sometimes from professor to
    professor), so **be sure to find out what's expected in a given
    class**. When an assignment involves analyzing a text, the words of
    the text itself will usually form the bulk of your evidence. You
    will therefore want to *quote* from the text extensively. Except in
    rare instances, your audience (the professor) will of course know
    the text, so you should avoid tedious retelling of plots or
    rehearsing of arguments. Depending on the discipline, evidence may
    also include appropriately interpreted statistics, appropriately
    cited [research](?pg=topics/research.html) findings from a worthy
    source, original data, and (when required or invited by
    the assignment) personal experience.
-   A good persuasive essay heads off likely **counterarguments**.
    Many writers mistakenly believe that they should avoid all reference
    to ideas or facts that might be raised against them. In fact, the
    strongest writing forthrightly acknowledges possible objections and
    puts them in perspective. Such honesty not only increases the
    writer's credibility but also gives him or her the opportunity for
    "prebuttal" - rebuttal before the fact. There are two main
    strategies for anticipating objections:
-   You can *concede* that the counterargument or contrary evidence has
    merit but insist that it does no damage to the overall validity of
    your contention. A concession takes the general form, "While it is
    true that . . . nevertheless . . . "
-   You can *refute* the counterargument or contrary evidence by
    explaining why it's illogical or faulty.

### Organization: Conclusion

If introductions typically start broad and end narrow, conclusions most
often move the opposite way: they begin by reminding the reader of the
main argument, then push on toward more general concerns. To adopt a
different metaphor, conclusions tend to look backward and forward
simultaneously - backward toward the body of the essay, forward toward
related ideas and issues. You might, for example, point out how your
thesis, if true, should reorient the reader's thinking on some other
matter. Conclusions are also good places for speculation; if you adopt
appropriately tentative language, your reader will accept that your
evidence here doesn't meet the same high standard you've held to in the
body of your essay.

Some of the same errors that plague introductions turn up in
conclusions, such as

-   pompous sermonizing about Great Truths;
-   inclusion of irrelevant facts;
-   mechanical repetition of the assignment's original wording (or of
    the writer's own thesis);
-   writing about writing (e.g., "In this essay I have shown . . . ");
-   unwarranted autobiography;
-   praising the bard (or the professor; e.g., "I learned a great deal
    from this assignment . . . ").

Some additional advice about conclusions:

-   Don't omit the conclusion. If you simply end the paper with the
    final example of your last main point, you're cheating both your
    reader and yourself. Moving from the narrow to the broad, as
    described above, gives you the opportunity to figure out what you've
    discovered in the process of writing; it also makes you accountable
    for the larger implications of your argument.
-   Don't apologize. Apologies - e.g., "I don't really understand this
    topic" or (worse) "I was very upset while I was writing this and I
    hope you will take that into consideration while you are grading
    it" - are simply another way of avoiding responsibility for
    your argument. Besides, if your paper is really as dreadful as your
    apology suggests, whining only underscores its inadequacies, while
    if it's not so bad as you thought, expressing uncertainty may
    actually undermine whatever favorable impression you've made.
    Finally, apologies tacked on with post-its or index cards are no
    better than those included in the essay. If you're unhappy with your
    performance, apologize to yourself and resolve to do better
    next time.
-   As in your introduction, use quotations judiciously. (See
    [Introduction](#introduction).)
